This is the final project for the Unix course. Originally, we were planning to make a
Scheculer app, but due to time constraints, this was impossible. Instead, we decided
as a team that we will create a website which will represent us as a group (The 
Problem Solvers), which will contain all our team projects, as well as some of our
personal projects.

The goal of this project is to create a website to host our projects and it works
as a portfolio. It is a nice way to present our works to employers and anyone in
the future. 

Before getting access to the website, there is a login page in which only the developpers
can login to show their work to others. One of our developers will securise this by 
making cookies to be able to see if a user can go to the main page. 

Our website will start on a page that introduces our current newest project. It will have
a title and description for it, as well as a link that brings you to a photo gallery of 
the project. That Gallery will then have a Go Back Button to go back to the main page.

We will then have a Group Repository page that will host all the projects we have done
together as a team.
For now, it includes the following projects:
- ATM MACHINE (JAVA)
- MAZE BOMBERS GAME (JAVA)
- DENTIST DATABASE (SQL)
- CAD/CAM PC BUILD
- PROBLEM SOLVERS CAFÃ‰ (VISUAL C#)

Furthermore, we have a merchandise page which is a cool design and idea we can use for
future professional ideas, goals and motives.

Additionally, each developper created their own personal repository which hosts whatever
personal project they want to showcase.

A navigation bar is added at the top of the screen to navigate easily through each page.

All developers worked on each part of the project. The only difference is that they had 
different parts to mainly focus on. 

Ali Zoubeidi: 
19 years old and a 3rd semester Computer Science Student. Ali was mostly
focused on the Main Page and Gallery Page, the Personal Repositories, and working on files
such as the README.md file and the INSTALL.md file. 

Jeremie Guerchon: 
19 years old and a 3rd semester Computer Science Student. Jeremie's main
focus was the design of the website and the Login Page, the navigation bar and the Cookies part.

Vincent Benesen: 
21 years old and a 3rd semester Computer Science Student. Vincent's main focus
was the Merchandise Page, INSTALL.md file, and the Group Repository page. Vincent was also a
huge moral support contributor.
