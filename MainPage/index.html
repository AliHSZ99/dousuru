            <h1>NEWEST PROJECT</h1>
            <p>
                This newest project we released is a Café application made with C#. We want to give users the opportunity
                to enjoy getting food at our café safely and elegantly with our sleek design. You can see it know!
                Here's a couple of screenshots below which presents the design of our new app.
